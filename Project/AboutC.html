	  <h4  id="head1" align="center">Hyperautomation</h4>
	  <p>Hyperautomation brings together several components of process automation, integrating tools and technologies that amplify the ability to automate work.
	  It starts with robotic process automation (RPA) at its core, and expands automation capability with artificial intelligence (AI), process mining, analytics, and other advanced tools.
      The idea is to automate more and more knowledge work, and engage everyone in an organization to be part of the transformation. 
	  Hyperautomation builds on the momentum behind RPA, led by the democratization of automation and IT and accelerated by the liberation of mundane and repetitive tasks for workers across every industry. 
	  In many ways, hyperautomation is redefining work. 
	  <br />
	  Hyperautomation builds on the real success that underlies the phenomenal growth of RPA: ease of automation, speed to outcomes, and a now proven path to applying artificial intelligence (AI) to improve business operations. 
	  RPA has delivered digital transformation faster than any other technology by starting with the business first and foremost.</p>

	   <h4 id="head2" align="center">Multiexperience</h4>
	   <p>Multiexperience is a concept pioneered by Gartner late in 2019. The concept is being championed as one of the biggest developments for 2020. In fact, Gartner states that “more than 25% of the mobile apps, progressive web apps and conversational apps at large enterprises will be built and/or run through a multiexperience development platform” by 2023.
      In short, multiexperience is about adapting to the increasing market of different devices and their respective experiences. 
	  Applications now need to run on different platforms and adapt easily, all while providing a consistent experience from a business perspective.
	  <br />
      Why is this relevant? For one, it’s because a few companies are already doing it and, for another, it’s because the average individual currently owns 3.2 different devices. 
	  In other words, it’s becoming the increasingly expected norm.
	  But, other than a few key examples, little more is known than this. This is where we’re here to help.</p>

	    <h4 id="head3" align="center">Distributed Cloud</h4>
		<p>Edge computing in telecom, provides execution resources (compute and storage) for applications with networking close to the end users, typically within or at the boundary of operator networks.
         Edge computing can also be placed at enterprise premises, for example inside factory buildings, in homes and vehicles, including trains, planes and private cars. 
		 The edge infrastructure can be managed or hosted by communication service providers or other types of service providers.
         The main benefits edge solutions provide include low latency, high bandwidth, device processing and data offload as well as trusted computing and storage.
		 <br />
		 Distributed cloud is the application of cloud computing technologies to interconnect data and applications served from multiple geographic locations. 
		 Distributed, in an information technology (IT) context, means that something is shared among multiple systems which may also be in different locations.</p>
